# College Sports Management System
A website in which we can update the scores directly and it also includes admin side and client side.

## Motivation
We made this website so that we dont have to write all the scores manually, which is a very tireing job to do!

## Technologies used
It has technologies like C# in the frontend part of the website 
and it has mySQL at the backend part of the website..

## Features
The extra features that we have included in our projects based on our research are editing the teams, registratation forms acc to different sports events, providing kits for essentials

## Installation
You need to install Visual Studio (not Vs code) to make sure this project runs perfectly with the users interactions too.
